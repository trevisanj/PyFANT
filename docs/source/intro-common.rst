Welcome!

Pyfant is a Python interface to `PFANT <http://trevisanj.github.io/PFANT>`_, a stellar
spectral synthesis code for Astronomy originally written in Fortran. Pyfant provides
different ways to run spectral synthesis: command-line or graphical interface; single or batch mode.
It also includes many additional tools to open, edit, visualize, convert and manipulate data files
and spectra, and an API (application programming interfce) to create your own spectral
synthesis applications in Python.

This documentation contains three main sections:

#. :doc:`Examples of coding using the API <coding>`
#. :doc:`A human-readable explanation os the conversion of molecular lines algorithm <convmol>`.
   We chose to document this work in progress in this way in order to comunicate with other
   members of the team.
#. :doc:`A reference to all the scripts available when Pyfant is installed <scripts>`.
   This includes command-line and graphical interfaces.

For a tutorial on spectral synthesis using PFANT and Pyfant, please visit the PFANT project
website: `<trevisanj.github.io/PFANT>`_.
