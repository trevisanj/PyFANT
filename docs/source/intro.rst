Introduction
============

PyFANT is a Python interface to `PFANT <http://trevisanj.github.io/PFANT>`_, a stellar
spectral synthesis code for Astronomy originally written in Fortran. PyFANT provides
different ways to run spectral synthesis: command-line or graphical interface; single or batch mode.
It also includes many additional tools to open, edit, visualize, convert and manipulate data files
and spectra, and an API (application programming interfce) to create your own spectral
synthesis applications in Python.

This documentation addresses coding with the PyFANT API, and provides a reference to the scripts
included in the ``pyfant`` package.

For a tutorial on spectral synthesis using PFANT and PyFANT, please visit the PFANT project
