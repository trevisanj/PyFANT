# pyfant

Welcome!!

pyfant is a Python interface for the 
[PFANT Spectral Synthesis Software](PFANT project: http://github.com/trevisanj/PFANT)
for use in Astronomy.

Appart from spectral synthesis, it provides tools of conversion, data editing,
and visualization, and a programming library to embed spectral synthesis into your code.

# <a name=S1></a>1 Introduction

The `pyfant` Python package was created as a Python interface for PFANT, a Fortran-developed
Spectral Synthesis Software for use in Astronomy (http://github.com/trevisanj/PFANT).

Spectral Synthesis Softwares (SSS) have several applications in Astronomy. Spectral synthesis is a
crucial step in optimization algorithms, in which the synthetic spectrum is compared with the
measure spectrum of a star, in order to determine stellar properties -- such as temperature,
metallicity, and chemical abundances -- in an iterative fashion.

`pyfant` was first created with the intention to provide an object-oriented library to develop such
algorithms in Python. It allows one to create several "spectral synthesis cases" (_e.g._ similar
calculations where only the chemical abundance of one element will vary slightly) and run these cases
in parallel.

The package has since evolved to provide many graphical and command-line applications to perform
many convenient tasks:
  - editors for many of the file types involved
  - plotting tools
  - conversion of atomic and molecular lines from/to standards from other research groups

`pyfant` is under active development, and we hope that you
will find it useful. If you would like to contribute or have any issues or suggestions, please send

# <a name=S4></a>4 Tasks

This section briefly describes some tasks that can be performed with `pyfant` applications.

## 4.1 Spectral Synthesis from Scratch

Shell commands:
```shell
mkdir mystar
cd mystar
copy-star.py
link.py common
x.py
```

The last command will invoke the PFANT Launcher: 

  1. Change parameters in Tab 1/2/3 (Tab 4 is a different story) 
  2. Click on the "Submit single job" button: a new window named "Runnables Manager" opens
  3. When the "Status" column shows "nulbad finished", double-click on the table item: "PFANT Explorer" window opens
  4. Double-click on "flux.norm": turns green (if wasn't so)
  5. Double-click on "Plot spectrum": spectrum appears

## 4.2 Browsing files with PFANT Explorer

```shell
explorer.py
```

This application allows you to navigate through your file system and visualize/edit files,
depending on their type. 

You can select several spectral files and plot them all at once (stacked in different sub-plots,
or overlapped in a single plot).

## 4.3 <a name=S4_3></a> Converting "VALD3 extended" format atomic lines

The Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD) is "a 
collection of atomic and molecular transition parameters of astronomical interest"
(http://vald.astro.uu.se/).

To convert from the "VALD3 extended" to a "PFANT atomic lines" file:

```shell
vald3-to-atoms.py <prefix>.vald3x
tune-zinf atoms-<prefix>-untuned.dat
```

This is done in two steps. The first step, `vald3-to-atoms.py` does the actual conversion
(which is quick) and saves a file, _e.g._, `atoms.dat`

The second step (which is time-consuming) is performed by `tune-zinf.py` and aims
to tune an important parameter used by the `pfant` Fortran binary.

It is recommended to use the tool `cut-atoms.py` to cut the file converted by
`vald3-to-atoms.py` to a wavelength region of interest before running `tune-zinf.py`.

For more information, see help for `vald3-to-atoms.py`, `tune-zinf.py`,
`cut-atoms.py` (call these scripts with `--help` option).


# <a name=S6></a> Programming using `pyfant`

## Minimal example

```python
from pyfant import *
obj = Pfant()
obj.run()
```
This is equivalent to running `pfant` from the command line.

## Running innewmarcs, hydro2, pfant, nulbad in sequence

```python
from pyfant import *
obj = Combo()
obj.run()
```

## More examples

  - The _demos_ directory contains a few (non-exhaustive) examples of how
    to use pyfant to perform different tasks. [](demos/README.md).

  - [`run4.py` source code](scripts/run4.py)
  

# <a name=S7></a>7 Troubleshooting

## Tracking down why Fortran binaries fail to run

pyfant creates a "session directory" named `session-xxx` every time it attempts
to run a PFANT binary. Each of these directories will always contain at least two files:
  - _commands.log_ -- this is the command lines attempted. You can copy-paste this
    line in your console to see how the Fortran binary goes.
  - _fortran.log_ -- messages printed by the Fortran binary.

Commonly, inspecting these files will be enough to figure out what happened.

Your current directory will also have a file named _python.log_, containing
debug/info/warning/error messages from Python.

:bulb: `explorer.py` has a "Collect Fortran errors" button, which
recurses directories in search for error/warning messages in all files named `fortran.log`

## Metallicity/temperature/gravity of star is outside range in the grid of models
  
You can activate option "--allow True" to make bypass this check, but beware that the calculation
may be incorrect.

This can be done in the command line, _e.g._, `run4.py --allow T`, or check option "--alow"
in Tab 3 of `x.py`.
