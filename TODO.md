# TODO list

  - **SEE WHY PYFANT SETUP IS MESSING ASTROGEAR!!!!!!**


  - ~~OK implement ToScalar_UseNumPyFunc~~
  - ~~OK add combobox to XToScalar~~
  - ~~OK Smarter loading of Full Cube~~
  
  
  
  - ~~FIX MOLECULES FILE!!!!!
    comparing old x new moleculagrade
    perhaps best it is to keep both versions: contemplating diversity and whoever did whatever
    best would be to create an editor to mingle the molecules~~
  
  
  - Normalize("1") cause re-sampling, sth is not right
  - Fill origin when converting from FileFullCube to FileSpectrumList (somehow)
  - Get rid of WSpectrumList "More..." tab (make sure everything is implemented as blocks)
  - XHelpDialog is too ugly
  - Investigate what this a_XAtomsHistogram is about
  - Make sun Grevesse 1998 as default sun for pyfant
  - ~~legend=False in plot_*()~~
  - ~~p.conf.sid.clean() not intuitive~~
  - ~~easier to work with command line options~~
  - ~~nulbad load_result~~
  - Warn assumptions in ConvMol
  - ~~Resolve branches for other molecules~~ HITRAN OK
